# âœ… Onboarding Flow Setup Complete!

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Created

### 1. **Onboarding Page** (`frontend/src/components/OnboardingPage.tsx`)

A beautiful setup page for first-time users that includes:

- **Display Name Input**: Users can customize their name
- **First Notebook Creation**: Create their initial notebook
- **Skip Option**: Can skip and go directly to app
- Progress indicator at the bottom
- Feature tips to help them get started

### 2. **Smart Auth Callback** (`frontend/src/components/AuthCallback.tsx`)

Enhanced OAuth callback that:

- Checks if user has any notebooks
- **First-time users** â†’ Redirected to `/onboarding`
- **Returning users** â†’ Redirected to `/app`
- Handles errors gracefully

### 3. **Updated Backend** (`backend/src/routes/auth.ts`)

Auth endpoint now supports:

- Updating user's `displayName`
- Returns both settings and displayName

### 4. **Updated API Client** (`frontend/src/lib/api.ts`)

Added support for `displayName` in settings update

## ðŸš€ User Flow

### First-Time User:

1. User clicks "Continue with Google" on `/login`
2. Google OAuth authentication
3. Callback to `/auth/callback`
4. System checks: No notebooks found
5. **Redirects to `/onboarding`** âœ¨
6. User enters name and first notebook name
7. System creates notebook
8. Redirects to `/app`

### Returning User:

1. User clicks "Continue with Google" on `/login`
2. Google OAuth authentication
3. Callback to `/auth/callback`
4. System checks: Notebooks exist
5. **Redirects to `/app`** directly
